# Neural Network and Application

## Submitted by : Satvik Tiwari (200101091)
**Course**: DA623

This tutorial covers Neural Network from basics to advance. We first go through the basic building block of a NN i.e. Neuron and then go through a simple neural network with a hidden layer. Then we delve into a deep neural network and combat the challenge of overfitting.

For applications:
- We start with a computer vision problem of steganalysis. It's part of my BTP and we learn basics of convolutional layers.
- Then we explore the time series analysis of stock market using LSTM.

## How to Run an IPYNB File
1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, install Jupyter Notebook
2. **Download the IPYNB File**: Download the IPYNB file provided i.e. DA623-200101091.ipynb
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory where the IPYNB file is saved, and run the command:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. **Access the Notebook**: Once Jupyter Notebook opens in your web browser, navigate to the directory where your IPYNB file is located and click on it to open.
5. **Run the Notebook**: Inside Jupyter Notebook, you can run each cell of the IPYNB file by clicking on it and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the "Run" button in the toolbar.
